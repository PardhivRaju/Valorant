HAVEN</div>
<p class="p1"><center>
While Haven is the biggest map, it’s also the least spacious, due to the unique twists and turns the map presents you with.<br>
At times, it feels like it’s much better equipped for defending than for attacking, and if you hem your opponents in,<br>
 you can also leave them feel like they’ve got nowhere to go. Perhaps more than any other map in the game, a numerical advantage<br>
 can swing the momentum of a match in Haven.</center>

<div class="split" title="Map Removed">
SPLIT</div>
<p class="p2"><center>
If you want to go far, you’ll have to go up. A pair of sites split by an elevated center allows for rapid movement using two rope ascenders.<br> 
Each site is built with a looming tower vital for control. Remember to watch above before it all blows sky-high....

Valorant is the latest hero shooter on the market, a heady mix of Counter-Strike: Global Offensive and Overwatch that somehow<br>
 manages to combine many of the best aspects of the two. However, this mix means you'll need to know everything about both<br>
 the hero you're playing and the map you're playing on to make sure you're fragging to the best of your abilities.
